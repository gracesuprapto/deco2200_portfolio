                <p>During this week, we formed groups in our tutorials and discussed problem areas and our interests in a specific autonomous product, specifically vehicles. When forming groups, it was important to choose people that would each individually contribute their own skills and knowledge to ensure that we worked well as a team to come up with a solution. I chose people to work with that were better in a specific skill and area that I personally lacked in. Elaine’s strength is her ability to use Sketch and create wireframes. Miriam is able to create prototype and her skills in using the various tools will be a big help for our project. We named our group GEM, for Grace; Elaine and Miriam. </p>

                <p>We proceeded to do initial research and from it found that we were fascinated with autonomous buses as it is an area that is used very often and commonly by most people. Therefore, it would be an area that could be worked upon and researched further as it allows for more people to identify with it and relate to. It is also a problem area that could be solved through many different avenues and possibilities. We looked into many different areas such as education, health and education. Tossing around ideas such as creating a system that would allow efficient mobilisation of school children, tourism vehicles that allowed for easier transportation of tourists to move from one attraction to another and the movement of patients within hospitals. We looked into problem areas within these sectors and the more research we did to discover problems, allowed us to narrow down and weigh the pros and cons of the different sectors. </p>

                <p>After our initial primitive research and weighing the various pros and cons of the different sectors, we decided to continue with the tourism sector, specifically looking into group charters and the movement of tourists. By choosing the tourism industry, it is easily identifiable as travel and tourism is a common part of people’s lives as many have travelled before and travelling is on the rise. We looked into existing tourism companies such as the Hop on Hop off Bus. They are a commonly used and chosen way of transportation around famous landmarks in major cities such as New York, London and function in cities around Australia including Sydney.  </p>

The methods we came up with were, observations; interviews; questionnaires; context mapping; background research; metaphor design; experience prototyping; forced associations; Mindmapping; roleplay; scenarios; focus groups and contextual observations. From this list we divided it up so that we did not all do the same research methods.

                <p>The research method I chose were questionnaire, roleplay, focus groups and contextual observations. I chose to do questionnaires as they allow for responses that hone in on users’ initial and basic reactions to questions that prompt their thoughts on past and personal experiences through clear research questions. Questions are easy to answer and record which allows me to get larger amount of responses from a wider range of people. I also chose to do roleplay as it would show me how people react in a situation that is monitored and created. As autonomous vehicles are not used widely, by creating a make belief environment it would allow for a better perspective and to observe how people react to the situation. Focus groups allows for me to gain responses in a controlled environment where I can hear people’s thoughts and further ask questions about a specific topic that is prompted. Contextual observation will give me first hand understandings and findings of the physical behaviour a user may have while doing a task at a certain location. The location that I’ll chose to observe will provide insight into how the user interacts with the surroundings as well as the service. I then created the survey. I made sure that I chose questions that wouldn’t take very long to answer to gain a general census and understanding of people’s general ideas of automated buses.I included questions such as what the types of tours interested them the most and who they would travel with when visiting in a new place.

                <p> After re-evaluating the user research methods I was planning to use, I decided to choose to do different methods as I felt as though they would suit the data I was looking for more.  So the final research methods I chose to use were questionnaires, interviews and contextual observation. Interviews allow for a more in depth question and answer. It provides a qualitative understanding of the user’s wants, needs, frustrations and certain behaviours, compared to surveys which provide quantitative data.From the data collected from interviews, I used affinity diagrams for context inquiry to analyse and further understand the specific needs and wants of the user to create two personas.

                <p>From our individual reports, we combined our reports together and analysed our findings. We realised that most of our findings from the data we collected were similar. For example, the fact that people wanted to be able to choose where they wanted to go instead of following a strict schedule when on tour. This insight gave us knowledge on what we needed to design to be able to solve the user’s needs and wants. We each brainstormed ideas, writing each idea down even if they didn’t make sense. Then, narrowed it down into ideas that were feasible and something that could directly solve the users’ needs and wants. Some ideas that we considered was gamifying the tour process so that users could “choose their own adventure”. There would be different routes based on the different things the user wanted to explore and at each point they arrived at, they could scan a code and they would receive extra information about the place they were visiting. The autonomous aspect of this idea was that the bus would take them to the place, drop them off and then follow their GPS location to see when they would need to be picked up again. Although this concept was good, we did not think it incorporated the autonomous aspect of the project that was required. So we continued to ideate and think of different ideas that would solve the problem and meet the brief’s criteria.

              <p> From the previous week, as a group we re-evaluated our concepts with the design brief. From the feedback we received from our tutor, our concepts did not entirely meet the design brief as it did not fully encapsulate what we were meant to be addressing, the autonomous aspect of the brief. We had to reconsider and reread the brief to redesign what was wrong and how we could build upon it and fix it. However, during this process we came to a block and found it difficult to consider certain elements of our concepts that would be autonomous as our original ideas could have been completed with a human feature, such as the calling of a driver to be picked up. A problem that we encountered that was a massive and crucial road block within our ideation, was the fact that buses cater to a large amount of people, and the user’s needs indicated that they wanted a personalised experience, which was hard to do if the bus only catered to a large number of people. From this

              <p>insight, we decided to change our target audience from individual to groups. This still addressed the user’s needs and wants we gathered from our user research as majority of people indicated that they normally travelled in groups. Therefore, by changing the target audience, it gives room and allows us to create concepts that cater and create to a larger amount of people to solve their needs and wants in a different setting.

              <p>The 3 final concepts we came up with included a more defined solution to the autonomous aspect of the design brief. This included centring the autonomous aspect rather than the user experience to our concept and ensuring it created a way that surrounded the main aspect to our concept. Due to how hard it was to come up with new ideas, we were unable to draw storyboards and the schedule we created to set deadlines for tasks to be completed by was changed. However we worked together and divided certain tasks to ensure that we did not fall behind on our project.

This way, it allows them to envision what the actual interface of the app will look like.

                  <p> We gathered user’s to test randomly. We asked them for their experience with tours, so by asking people randomly it gave us insight to both those who have been on tours before and those who have not. From our initial tests, we noticed that people were clicking on things or doing actions that were not want we intended. However by observing what they were trying to do, it showed how we could improve and change things in our app. We struggled with our first test as it didn’t make sense to them so we had to redo it to ensure that it made sense for the future and that there were different and possible points that people could choose from through the interface’s options. This showed us that we were missing a lot of steps to ensure that it made sense for our tests. So from those observations we made changes that were necessary and relevant for the other 7 tests we needed to iterate of and to come up with new concepts. Altogether, we tested with 8 participants from different background and experiences with tour buses. This gave us a wide range of answers and necessary feedback to iterate and come up with the best possible design for our final interface.

                  <p> During our group meeting, we all dealt with stress. There was a lot of tension as we were all under a time crunch and felt the pressure of producing a concept that was futuristic but still served its purpose of what it needed to solve. At the early stages of creating our paper prototype we realised there were screens missing and things that didn’t flow well. This placed even more stress on us as we just wanted to begin testing but couldn’t as some screens didn’t make sense. After finally adjusting our screens and creating what was needed to make sure it flowed, we were able to start testing. We overcame our stress as we were able to start testing and move forward with our project.
